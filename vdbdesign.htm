<H2>Relational, and Non-Relational Databases:</H2>

<p class="Writeup">
SQL Server is the line of database management systems originally developed by Sybase, and acquired by Microsoft in the mid 1990's which became their flagship Database offering.  Validien has worked with SQL Server since version 7, and has experience developing and managing versions up to 2019.  We have also worked on database systems such as MySQL, NOSQL Mongo, CosmosDB, Oracle, and Pick.</p>

<p class="Writeup">
Whether your system is currently located "on-premise", co-located, in a hybrid-cloud, or hosted on Virtual Machines locally or in the public Cloud, Validien probably has working knowledge and experience on it.  We specialize in the Relational model, but understand that some of the orthodoxy of entity modelling has been relaxed in many systems which now handle semi-structured data (such as JSON or XML documents), or even documents, images, videos, etc - taking the form of BLOB storage.  All of these are valid data storage formats, and the need to keep such data in file folders, indexed through a database, is not always the most efficient storage and retrieval mechanism.  Validien can help you understand the types of data you are working with, and recommend solutions on a variety of persistence strategies.</p>
