<H2>Integration</H2>

<p class="Writeup">
80% Business Operations leaders, including those from service delivery, manufacturing, and supply chain, say data integration is critical to their success. Validien observes this isn't surprising, given the number of data and workflow integration points required to run business operations effectively and competitively.  When Executive Management places a higher priority on data integration than IT has traditionally, the rapid adoption of real-time reporting and monitoring applications that are proliferating across manufacturing and supply chain-based businesses today makes sense. 
</p>

<p class="Writeup">Validien Solutions deals with structured, semi-structured, and blob storage as suits the needs of your business.  We can migrate, cleanse, and board data into target systems, or prepare data for analytics.  Your data can be made available to exteral service providers through APIs or other conduits with data connections to a seemingly infinite number of formats.  We tend to deal with data formats that are as established as possible.  Many times though, a system or interface needs to be customized either for meaning, or optimized for speed.
</p>

<p class="Writeup">Validien uses such ETL / ELT systems as SQL Server Integration Services, Linked Servers, Polybase, Web Services, and BizTalk for the migration and shaping of data between systems.
</p>

<p class="Writeup">We are avaialble on-site or remotely perform a Gap analysis regarding your concepts and potential proglems in Data Integration.
